## Description
The pokemon games are a lovely experience, at the very least for the few first playthroughs. However, after that, there is not much of a challange left. That is, if you don't play with a self-imposed ruleset such as of a nuzlocke. A nuzlocke is in short a ruleset that compels you to only catch one pokemon per route, and if it faints you can no longer use it. For that reason, one must be thoroughly prepared in regards of the opponents they are facing. Therefore, this application is suited to let the player add the custom pokemon he or she is going to face, and then provide them to certain enemy trainers they are going to face in their journey.

This project's purpose was mainly for me to get in touch with Spring and Spring Boot, and slightly learn some core react, and by no means was the focus the aspect, as it shall be seen. This is the repository that marks the frontend, whereas the one responsible for the backend is at the following link [https://github.com/Chris4092/PokemonBackEnd]
